# Class 2: How to Design a Nano Recommender System
### **Introduction**

Hello everyone, welcome to the second class! In the previous lesson, we introduced the basic concepts of recommender systems and their common types. Today, we will learn how to design a **Nano Recommender System**.

You might be thinking: "Recommender systems sound complicated. Can I really build one?"

The answer is yes! Today, we do not need any complex mathematical formulas or large databases. We will simply use a **JSON file** to store data and **Streamlit**, a lightweight Python framework, to build a visual recommender system.

### **1. What Are the Necessary Parts for a Simple Demo?**

In a real-world recommender system, we usually need a lot of data, complex algorithms, and high-performance servers. However, if we just want to build a small demo, the core components are quite simple:

1. **Data Storage**: A place to store movie information, such as titles, genres, and ratings.
2. **Recommendation Logic**: A simple matching algorithm, such as recommending similar movies based on user preferences.
3. **Frontend Interface**: A way for users to input their preferences and view the recommendations.
4. **User Interaction**: A mechanism for users to select their preferences, such as choosing genres or rating movies.
5. **Data Retrieval and Processing**: The application needs to fetch data from storage, process it, and deliver meaningful recommendations.

So, our system **does not need** a database, complex machine learning models. If we can store data, write some Python code, and create a simple web interface, we can build this demo successfully.

### **2. Why Use JSON Instead of a Database?**

In production systems, databases like MySQL or MongoDB are commonly used for storing data. However, for our Nano Recommender System, JSON is a better choice for the following reasons:

- **Easy to Read**: JSON files are, making them easy to understand and modify.
- **No Database Installation Needed**: Reduces setup complexity, making it easier for beginners.
- **Suitable for Small Datasets**: If the dataset is small, JSON is sufficient.
- **Fast Iteration**: We can quickly modify the JSON file to update the data without interacting with a database.
- **Portability**: JSON files can be easily shared and used across different environments without additional setup.

Thus, we will store our data in a `movies.json` file, which will contain all the movie details.

### **Example JSON Data Structure**

Our `movies.json` file may look like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Inception",
        "genre": ["Sci-Fi", "Thriller"],
        "rating": 8.8
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "The Matrix",
        "genre": ["Sci-Fi", "Action"],
        "rating": 8.7
    }
]

```

Each movie is represented as an object containing attributes like ID, title, genres, and rating.

### **3. Why Use Streamlit Instead of Other Frameworks?**

Building a web application typically requires knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which may be challenging for Python beginners. **Streamlit** is a Python framework designed for data applications, offering several advantages:

- **Very Simple**: Requires minimal code to create a web application.
- **Built-in UI Components**: Provides buttons, text fields, sliders, and more, without needing HTML.
- **Live Updates**: Modifications to the Python code automatically update the web page.
- **Supports Data Visualization**: Easily displays data in tables, charts, and graphs.
- **Interactive Capabilities**: Enables users to select preferences and receive instant recommendations.

### **Example Streamlit Code**

In `app.py`, we can create a basic Streamlit page with the following code:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Nano Movie Recommender System")
st.write("Welcome to our movie recommendation system!")

```

Running this script will display a simple web pag with the title ‚ÄúNano Movie Recommender System.‚Äù

### **4. What is Code Structure?**

When writing an application, we need to organize different files properly so that the code is easy to manage and understand. We recommend structuring the project as follows:

```bash

nano_movie_recommender/
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main program that handles movie recommendations and displays the webpage
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ movies.json         # File that stores movie data
‚îÇ‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # List of Python libraries required for the project

```

### **What Does Each File Do?**

- **`app.py` (Main Program)**
    
    This is the core of the system. It is responsible for:
    
    1. Reading movie data from `movies.json`.
    2. Taking user input, such as selecting a preferred movie genre.
    3. Filtering and ranking movies based on the input and their ratings.
    4. Displaying the recommended movies on a webpage.
- **`movies.json` (Movie Data)**
    
    This file contains a list of movies with details like title, genre, and rating.
    
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a common data format, structured like this:
    
    ```json
    json
    CopyEdit
    [
        {
            "title": "Inception",
            "genre": "Sci-Fi",
            "rating": 8.8
        },
        {
            "title": "Titanic",
            "genre": "Romance",
            "rating": 7.8
        }
    ]
    
    ```
    
- **`requirements.txt` (Dependency List)**
    
    This file lists all the Python libraries required to run `app.py`.
    
    Instead of manually installing each library, you can install all of them at once using `requirements.txt`.
    
    Example `requirements.txt` file:
    
    ```
    nginx
    CopyEdit
    streamlit
    pandas
    
    ```
    
    - **`streamlit`** ‚Äì Used to create the web interface, allowing the recommendation system to run in a browser.
    - **`pandas`** ‚Äì Used for handling and analyzing movie data.

## **5. How Does the Movie Recommender System Work?**

Our recommender system will follow these steps:

### **1. Load JSON Data**

The program will read the `movies.json` file and store the movie data for processing.

### **2. Get User Input**

Users will interact with the webpage and select their preferred movie genre, such as "Sci-Fi" or "Romance."

### **3. Filter and Rank Recommendations**

The system will filter the movies based on the selected genre and rank them by rating.

### **4. Display the Recommendations**

The recommended movies will be displayed on the webpage in an easy-to-read format.

## **6. What‚Äôs Next?**

In the next lesson (**Class 3: How to Set Up the Development Environment**), we will learn:

- How to install Python (if you do not have it yet).
- How to use `pip`, Python‚Äôs package manager, to install the required libraries from `requirements.txt`.
- How to run `app.py` and see the movie recommendations on a webpage.

By the end of the next lesson, you will be able to run your own movie recommender system and see how it works! üé¨üçø
